            Foodio was created by Alex, Emily, Andrew, and Eman to help people find food near them. 
            Everyone knows that feeling, you are hungry, but you donâ€™t where you want to go. 
            Well, Foodio was made for you!
        </p>

            <p>
            All you have to do is enter your zip code and what you are craving and bam!
            Foodio shows you the restaurants menus in the area that have the food you are craving.
             Not only that, Foodio even gives you a list of all the restaurants in the area with their website and phone number based on the zip code entered.
            </p>

            <p>
            No more scrolling through Google and trying to find menus. 
            Say goodbye to Google maps and tapping on a bunch of little icons, and say hello to Foodio!
            </p>
